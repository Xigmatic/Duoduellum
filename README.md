# Duoduellum Plugin Repository

The Duoduellum tournament is a 8-game, 20-player, 10-team competition where each team plays a variety of unique minigames. This repository will eventually hold all project files for each Spigot plugin. The tournament will use a BungeeCord system, where the minigames being played are held on individual servers.

Each folder within this repository holds an individual plugin (excluding .idea) and will also include a pre-compiled jar file.

THIS IS IN BETA AND WILL NOT BE TESTED FOR A WHILE
